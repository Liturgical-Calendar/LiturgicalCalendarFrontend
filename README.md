Presentation of the Liturgical Calendar Project, using bootstrap theming.

The Liturgical Calendar project offers an API that generates data for the liturgical events in the General Roman Calendar. The data can be requested in JSON or XML format such that it can be consumed by any kind of application. It can also be requested in ICS format, so as to be consumed by any kind of iCal or Calendar application.

This frontend is an interface with documentation and examples for the API.

There are two national calendars built into the API, that of Italy and that of the USA, which can be requested through the `nationalCalendar` parameter.

The API is also extendable for Diocesan Calendars (currently only for those national calendars that are built into the API, i.e. Dioceses of Italy and of the USA).

The Diocesan Calendar data can be defined directly through the interfaces offered by this frontend.
